# Sustainable Goods
*A list of vendors for sustainable and humane goods.*


### Why?
Finding a list of goods that are made intentionally with sustainable materials and with humane labor is hard to find - so let's try to put some of them in one place.



### What Belongs?
Vendors, retailers, shops, etc. whose products are crafted with humane labor and sustainable materials. The vendor must have some semblence of proof (or at least a sensible claim) of how and where they are producing goods. If you don't believe a vendor listed here belongs, start a pull request and we'll get it sorted out together.
